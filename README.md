# Standard

Inspired by [Birthday Research's Sticky](https://github.com/BirthdayResearch/sticky), Standard is a collection of tools and services for building scalable JS/TS apps on different platforms.

`@waveshq/standard-*` aims to provide standard tooling and configurations for different platforms. Most platform specific library (e.g, Next.js, Electron, Tauri etc.) has its own set of rules to follow. `@waveshq/standard` aims to solve this problem so that contributors can just focus on development.

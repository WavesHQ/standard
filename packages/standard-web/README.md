`@waveshq/standard-web`

Standard web tools for scaffolding web applications. Our choice of framework is Next.js as a default for our web projects.

This package also includes a `tsconfig.json` which is customized for web usage.

Packages that are included are based on the requirements of Next.js to avoid version mismatch.
